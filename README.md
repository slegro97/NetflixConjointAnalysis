# NetflixConjointAnalysis
This data science project conducts a conjoint analysis to increase revenue for Netflix based on customer survey responses. The Python libraries Pandas, Numpy, and StatsModels are used for data processing, and data visualizations were created using MatPlotLib and Squarify. (This project was created for personal use; I have no association with Netflix)
