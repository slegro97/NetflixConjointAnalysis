# NetflixConjointAnalysis
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive data analysis on Netflix's customer survey data, aiming to boost revenue by identifying key customer preferences and behaviors. This project utilized Python for data processing, analysis, and visualization.

Key components of the project include:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: The data was loaded and processed using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scipy. This involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing it for analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed exploratory analysis was performed to uncover patterns and trends within the data. This included statistical summaries, visualizing customer segments, and identifying key features related to customer satisfaction and retention.
- Conjoint Analysis: I employed a conjoint analysis approach to determine which features of the Netflix service customers value most. This involved modeling customer preferences to simulate different pricing and service configurations to optimize revenue.
- Data Visualization: Leveraging matplotlib and seaborn, I created a series of informative visualizations, including heatmaps, bar charts, and scatter plots, to help stakeholders understand customer preferences and insights derived from the data.
- Actionable Insights: The analysis provided Netflix with valuable insights into which service features—such as pricing, content library, and user experience—are most likely to drive customer retention and increase revenue.

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real-world data, apply advanced statistical modeling, and deliver business-driven insights. It highlights my skills in Python programming, data visualization, and machine learning, and shows my ability to communicate technical findings in a meaningful way for decision-making.
